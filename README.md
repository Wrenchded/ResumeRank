# 🚀 ResumeRank AI
**Landing Your Dream Job with Gemini 3 Flash**

ResumeRank AI is an end-to-end AI-powered career tool designed to bridge the gap between job seekers and Applicant Tracking Systems (ATS). Instead of guessing why a resume isn't getting hits, users get an instant, data-driven audit comparing their skills against real-world job descriptions.

2. **AI Processing:** A Google Apps Script triggers the **Gemini 3 Flash API** to perform a deep-analysis of the resume's alignment with the JD.
3. **Automated Reporting:** Within seconds, the system generates a "Match Score," identifies "Keyword Gaps," and emails a professional report directly to the user.
